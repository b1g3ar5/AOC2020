# AOC2020

Advent of Code challenges for 2020 in Haskell.

Maybe I'll get to the end this year...

I used the puzzles to try out some Haskell packages - so a few rarely used
packages might make an appearance.

Some days are solved multiple times to compare packages for speed, ease of use etc.

Day 23 is really slow - about 3 minutes.
